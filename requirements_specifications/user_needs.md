## Agreed Goals

[comment]: # (Has there been a clear statement of the overall goal of this project that the stakeholders agree to? If so, paste it here or add a hyperlink. If not, you should summarize your understanding of the project goals into a brief statement and try to get the stakeholders to agree to it. The text below gives three alternative examples, select one, or write your own.)

## Environment

[comment]: # (Briefly describe various aspects of the environment where the software will be used. Describe the environment as it is or will be, not what you would wish it to become. The text below gives a few examples.)

### What is the system's business environment

### What is the system's physical environment

### What is the system's technology environment (hardware and software)

## Stakeholder / Actors

[comment]: # (List and describe the stakeholders for this product. These can be named individuals or roles that people play. For each stakeholder, list/rank their key needs. Consider the expected technical expertise of the stakeholders and how often they are likely to use the system, as well as key strengths, weaknesses, preferences, or other characteristics. Use a greater-than sign to indicate inheritance among types of actors.)

[comment]: # (TIP: To get information on types of users, you can talk to actual users. You may also want to talk to user surrogates, such as domain experts, technical trainers, technical support staff, technical writers, supervisors of users, and your own sales and marketing department. You can find clues in manuals and marketing materials for competing products.)

## Notes From Interviews / Brainstorming

[comment]: # (Keep a log of your requirements gathering. Paste in notes from any face-to-face or telephone conversations with stakeholders or from brainstorming sessions with members of the development team. If the communication took place via email, link to it in the archive or paste it here.)

## User Stories

[comment]: # (Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system, directly and indirectly, to accomplish a real-world goal. User stories are not use cases: user stories are brief 3-5 sentences paragraphs that describe one specific scenario in concrete terms. In this description of user needs, do not make assumptions about details of the system, instead focus on the users. Note the source of each user story.)

## Performance and Capacity Needs

[comment]: # (Briefly list the stakeholders' desired values for various aspects of the system capacity. If you have a good idea about averages or rates of increase, note that as well.)
