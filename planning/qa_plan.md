## QA Strategy

[TODO]: # (For each activity, specify the coverage or frequency that you plan to achieve. If you do not plan to perform an activity, write "N/A".)

## QA Strategy Evaluation

[TODO]: # (Use the following table to evaluate how well your QA Strategy will assure your QA goals.)

| Goal   | Activity 1 | Activity 2 | Activity N | Overal Assrance |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Goal 1 | Medium     | Medium     | High       | Strong          |
| Goal 2 | Medium     | Medium     | High       | Strong          |
| Goal 3 | Medium     | Low        | Low        | Weak            |
| Goal N | Medium     | None       | None       | At-Risk         |

### Evaluation Cell Values

* **High**: This activity gives a strong assurance that the goal has been met in development.
* **Medium**: This activity gives a medium assurance that the goal has been met in development.
* **Low**: This activity gives only a little assurance that the goal has been met in development.
* **None**: This activity does not address the goal.

### Overall Assurance Values

* **Strong**: The set of activities together provide strong assurance that the goal has been met in development.
* **Weak**: The activities together provide limited assurance that the goal has been met in development.
* **At-Risk**: There is little or no assurance that this goal has been met.

## Plan of Action

[TODO]: # (Define action items necessary to achieve intended goal of each activity.)
