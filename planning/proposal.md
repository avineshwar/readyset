## Background and Motivation

[comment]: # (What are the needs or problems that you are trying to address? Why do these needs exist? Why are these problems worth solving? Who is the customer? Write 2-4 paragraphs.)

**What is the setting and history behind this project?**

**What is the problem to be addressed?**

**What are some of the current approaches to this problem?**

**How will this product be better than previous approaches?**

**Where is more information on this problem?**

## Goal

**What is the goal of this project?**

[comment]: # (This should be relatively short since you can reference terms defined above)

**What are the defining features and benefits of this product?**

**What are other documents that further explain the goal of this project?**

[comment]: # (Ex: Mockups, Early User Stories, Comparison with competitors, Draft feature list)

## Scope

[comment]: # (What are the high-level things that you plan to do, and that you will not do? What are your important simplifying assumptions? Try to guard against reasonable misunderstandings that might arise if you did not explain the scope. It can take the form of a paragraph, bullet list, in/out list, and/or UML context diagram.)

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
| -------- | ------------ |
|          |              |
|          |              |
|          |              |

## Deliverables

[comment]: # (Briefly list project deliverables. When you are done, what will you deliver to the customer? This can be copied from the draft project plan and simplified to reduce technical detail.)

## Risks and Rewards

[comment]: # (Briefly list and rank major risks. Risks are detailed in the draft project plan. For this proposal document, you should select the most important risks from the project plan and explain them in non-technical terms.)

**What are the main risks of this project?**

**What are the main rewards if this project succeeds?**
