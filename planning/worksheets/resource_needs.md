**Process impact**: Based on the project plan and the worksheet below, this project will need the following resources to meet its goals. If fewer resources are available, the scope of the release should be reconsidered or the process must be changed.

## Resources Needs Checklist

The goal of this checklist is to help expose resource needs that might otherwise be missed. It does not help with the actual estimated number of hours needed. Those estimates should be based on the project plan.

### Does this project need more than a few days work

### Are the requirements already completely defined and validated

### What aspects of the system need to be designed

### Does the project plan include any new development

### Does the project plan include complex configuration of existing components

### Does the development team have knowledge of all tools, components, and technologies to be used

### Is the entire development team have an agreed upon software development methodology

### Does the project plan include end-user documentation

### What is the complexity of the internal documentation

### Will the technical support, training, operations, or services groups deal with the product of this project

### Will the product of this project be sold to customers, directly or indirectly

### Does the QA plan call for the running of automated unit tests

### Does the QA plan call for more than the running of automated unit tests

### How many development workstations will be needed

### What development servers are needed

### What database servers are needed

### What machines are needed for automated testing

### What machines are needed for load testing

### What development tools must be licensed for this project

### What software components must be licensed for this project

### Are any of the personnel assignments of capital allocations conditional
